<h1>Earl-y Years</h1>
    <p>When Thebe Kgositsile was a young man he started rapping on internet forums, and was quickly noticed for his shocking ability considering his age. At the time of his initial rise he was only 16 years old. He was noticed by fellow rappers in the collective Odd Future, and started going by the name earl. More information on Earl's early life is available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Sweatshirt"> on Wikipedia.</a></p>

<h2>First album</h2>
    <p>In his first few years, earls' raps were <em>incredibly</em> vulgar and shocking with their lyrical content. He would be sent to a camp in Samoa by his mother saying that he needed to be straightened out, due to his drug use. After coming back after a year and a half he would release his debut album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_(album)">Doris,</a> which was a much more mature album.</p>
